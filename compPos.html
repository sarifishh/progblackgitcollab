        <h1>Computing and the Internet has Made a Great Deal of Difference to Education</h1>

        <p> In terms of applications, the amount of educational software used to help teach students that weren't there 20-30 years ago is massive.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the advent of the internet has been a great boon to research and enabling people to learn information beyond that which exists in their local library.</p>

        <p> Why I am not going into further detail about this</p>

        <ol start = 1>
            <li>There is not enough detail in the assignments</li>
            <li> This is not a research class so I am not doing copious amounts of research for the purpose of making a website that has no reason</li>
            <li>I'd much rather write about something I could easily think about at the moment which is currently explaining why I am not expounding on the information</li>
        </ol>
