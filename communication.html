        1.  The evolution of computers and their pervasiveness
        <ol>
    </h1>
    Computers have evolved from massive, room-filling machines in the mid-20th century to portable devices we carry in our pockets. This evolution has made computers accessible to billions of people, enabling their integration into daily life.

a. From specialized tools to everyday necessities - Initially, computers were used exclusively in scientific research and military applications. Over time, they became mainstream tools in business, education and households. Today, personal computers, laptops and smartphones are ubiquitous, blurring the lines between work and personal life.
b. Connectivity and the Internet - The integration of computers with the internet has amplified their societal impact. The ability to access vast amounts of information, connect with people worldwide and perform a wide array of tasks online has redefined the concept of global connectivity.
    <h2><ol> 2.  The role of computers in communication</h2><ol>
    The advent of computers has revolutionized communication, making it faster, more efficient and more accessible.

a. Digital Communication Channel - Email, instant messaging and social media platforms have replaced traditional methods of communication like postal mail and landline telephony. These tools enable instant interaction across geographical boundaries.
Example: Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter (X) and WhatsApp, allow people to connect, share ideas and maintain relationships regardless of physical distance.
b. Remote Work and Collaboration - Computers facilitate remote work through video conferencing, cloud storage and collaborative tools. This shift was especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, when businesses and institutions adopted remote operations to ensure continuity.
Example: Platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Google Workspace enable real-time collaboration among teams dispersed across different locations.
